## STRESS-DES

Of the **24** items in the checklist:

* **17** were met fully (‚úÖ)
* **6** were partially met (üü°)
* **1** was not met (‚ùå)

| Item | Recommendation | Met by study? | Evidence |
| - | - | - | - |
| **Objectives** | 
| 1.1 Purpose of the model | Explain the background and objectives for the model | ‚úÖ Fully | Extensive description of healthcare context, gaps in the literature, and how this model addresses these. For example, from the `Introduction`: <br>‚Ä¢ The model "can provide researchers and analysts in other countries with similar hierarchical public health systems with a template for developing models of similar primary/secondary healthcare facilities"<br>‚Ä¢ "We found very limited work that utilises a generic modelling approach for simulating primary healthcare delivery facilities that handle multiple patient types (with distinct clinical and operational flows through multiple facility units) and services (the PHC provides outpatient care, childbirth, antenatal services, limited inpatient care, pharmacy and clinical laboratory services). Thus, another key research contribution of this study involves addressing the above research gap."<br><br>@shoaib_simulation_2021 |
| 1.2 Model outputs | Define all quantitative performance measures that are reported, using equations where necessary.  Specify how and when they are calculated during the model run along with how any measures of error such as confidence intervals are calculated. | üü° Partially | A few example measures are mentioned in the `Introduction`: "Operational outcomes such as the average waiting time of patients for various resources (e.g., doctors, pharmacy, clinical laboratory), resource utilisation levels across the PHC, and the proportions of childbirth patients who wait longer than a certain time threshold."<br><br>In `Table 6`, a few measures are briefly defined - e.g. "Mean length of pharmacy queue (number of patients)". However, many measures are not defined.<br><br>@shoaib_simulation_2021 |
| 1.3 Experimentation aims | If the model has been used for experimentation, state the objectives that it was used to investigate.<br>(A) Scenario based analysis ‚Äì Provide a name and description for each scenario, providing a rationale for the choice of scenarios and ensure that item 2.3 (below) is completed.<br>(B) Design of experiments ‚Äì Provide details of the overall design of the experiments with reference to performance measures and their parameters (provide further details in data below).<br>(C) Simulation Optimisation ‚Äì (if appropriate) Provide full details of what is to be optimised, the parameters that were included and the algorithm(s) that was be used.  Where possible provide a citation of the algorithm(s). | ‚úÖ Fully  | Scenarios were sufficiently described throughout that I was able to reproduce (although language could be a little bit ambiguous in some places).<br><br>Example of scenario description from `4.3.1 Doctor's Utilisation`: "The sensitivity analyses reveal that at an average outpatient load of 170 patients per day, the utilisation of doctors increases substantially with increases in the mean service time and exceeds 100% at an average consultation time of five minutes/patient, implying that doctors may stay longer than the designated working hours to serve all patients arriving within the designated working hours. To address this, we experimented with letting the staff nurse (whose utilisation is approximately 32%) take over the administrative work. This led to a 12% drop in the utilisation level, which implied that the doctor‚Äôs utilisation still exceeded 100%."<br><br>@shoaib_simulation_2021  |

If reneging, balking or jockeying occur, etc., provide details of the rules. Detail any delays or capacity constraints on the queues. | ‚úÖ Fully | Described in `3.3 Patient Flow` - for example, `3.3.2 Inpatient Department`: "inpatients have nonpreemptive priority in comparison to outpatients with regard to consulting with the doctor ‚Äì that is, if the doctor is busy with an outpatient when an inpatient arrives, the inpatient moves to the head of the outpatient queue. The doctor then attends to the inpatient once they are finished consulting with the outpatient" |

The warm-up period, per usual simulation practice, was run with the same set of patient arrival and service rates as in the steady state period (see Table 3 and Table 4). The duration of the warm-up period was chosen to allow a sufficient amount of time for the simulation outcomes to achieve steady state."<br><br>@shoaib_simulation_2021 |

| Item | Assessed if... | Met by study? | Evidence/location |
| - | - | - | - |
| **Model conceptualisation** |
| 1 Is the focused health-related decision problem clarified? | ...the decision problem under investigation was defined. DES studies included different types of decision problems, eg, those listed in previously developed taxonomies. | ‚úÖ Fully | `1 Introduction`: "Although there has been a considerable increase in the number of PHCs across the country, i.e., from 9,115 during 1981-85 to 25,650 in 2017,13 their operational effectiveness and influence on improving public health accessibility is not adequately quantified. In this backdrop, there is need for an assessment of theoperational aspects of these facilities before more resources are invested in their upgradation and/or establishing new PHC infrastructure."<br><br>@shoaib_simulation_2021 |
| 2 Is the modeled healthcare setting/health condition clarified? | ...the physical context/scope (eg, a certain healthcare unit or a broader system) or disease spectrum simulated was described. | ‚úÖ Fully | Wider context provided in `1 Introduction`, e.g. "Outside large public hospitals in urban metropolitan areas that provide highly specialised tertiary care (called superspecialty hospitals), the public health system in India comprises three levels of formal medical care: the primary health centre (PHC, which offers primary care), the community health centre (CHC, which offers primary and limited secondary care), and the district hospital (DH, which offers comprehensive secondary and limited tertiary care)."<br><br>Additional description in `Appendix A`: Overview of Public Health System in India<br><br>@shoaib_simulation_2021 |
| 3 Is the model structure described? | ...the model‚Äôs conceptual structure was described in the form of either graphical or text presentation. | ‚úÖ Fully | Model configurations described extensively in `3.3 Patient Flow`.<br><br>`Figure 1`: Patient flow in the archetypal PHC<br>![Figure 1: Patient flow in the archetypal PHC](../original_study/fig1.png){.lightbox}<br><br>@shoaib_simulation_2021 |
| 4 Is the time horizon given? | ...the time period covered by the simulation was reported. | ‚úÖ Fully | Run length in `4 Simulation Experiments and Results`: "The simulation was run for 365 days, with a warm-up period of 180 days"<br><br>@shoaib_simulation_2021 |
| 5 Are all simulated strategies/scenarios specified? | ...the comparators under test were described in terms of their components, corresponding variations, etc | ‚úÖ Fully | Scenarios were sufficiently described throughout that I was able to reproduce (although language could be a little bit ambiguous in some places).<br><br>Example of scenario description from `4.3.1 Doctor's Utilisation`: "The sensitivity analyses reveal that at an average outpatient load of 170 patients per day, the utilisation of doctors increases substantially with increases in the mean service time and exceeds 100% at an average consultation time of five minutes/patient, implying that doctors may stay longer than the designated working hours to serve all patients arriving within the designated working hours. To address this, we experimented with letting the staff nurse (whose utilisation is approximately 32%) take over the administrative work. This led to a 12% drop in the utilisation level, which implied that the doctor‚Äôs utilisation still exceeded 100%."<br><br>@shoaib_simulation_2021 |
| 6 Is the target population described? | ...the entities simulated and their main attributes were characterized. | ‚úÖ Fully | Throughout paper, as in 2 Is the modeled healthcare setting/health condition clarified? |
| **Paramaterisation and uncertainty assessment** |
| 7 Are data sources informing parameter estimations provided? | ...the sources of all data used to inform model inputs were reported. | ‚úÖ Fully | Very detailed description. Examples...<br><br>`3.1 Generic Modelling Approach and PHC Operational Data Collection`:"We visited nine PHCs (out of ten total) in a north Indian district with a mix of urban, semi-urban, and rural populations to collect data regarding PHC operations. Permission to visit these PHCs and collect operational data was obtained from the district civil surgeon. Data collected included operational patterns (e.g., patient flow), staffing and resource levels"...<br><br>Table 1: Data summary of staffing level, patient load and other facilities at PHCs<br>![Table 1: Data summary of staffing level, patient load and other facilities at PHCs](../original_study/tab1.png){.lightbox}<br><br>Table 2: Service time summary for key PHC resources<br>![Table 2: Service time summary for key PHC resources](../original_study/tab2.png){.lightbox}<br><br>`3.2.1 Benchmark PHC Configuration`: "we estimated the demand for primary care using morbidity data from the Brookings India report.

Next, using the percentage contribution of each disease"... (continues)<br><br>@shoaib_simulation_2021 |
| 8 Are the parameters used to populate model frameworks specified? | ...all relevant parameters fed into model frameworks were disclosed. | üü° Partially | Nearly all information required was provided, with examples like `Table 3:` PHC configurations<br>![Table 3: PHC configurations](../original_study/tab3.png)<br><br>The exception is that sometimes the number of arrivals per day is provided, but the required interarrival time to model this is not provided, nor a formula for calculation of this.<br><br>@shoaib_simulation_2021 |
| 9 Are model uncertainties discussed? | ...the uncertainty surrounding parameter estimations and adopted statistical methods (eg, 95% confidence intervals or possibility distributions) were reported. | üü° Partially | Standard deviations provided for `Table 6`, but otherwise, mostly just mean results. |
| 10 Are sensitivity analyses performed and reported? | ...the robustness of model outputs to input uncertainties was examined, for example via deterministic (based on parameters‚Äô plausible ranges) or probabilistic (based on a priori-defined probability distributions) sensitivity analyses, or both. | ‚úÖ Fully | Section with sensitivity analyses: `4.3. Sensitivity Analysis and Configuration Optimisation`  |
| **Validation** |
| 11 Is face validity evaluated and reported? | ...it was reported that the model was subjected to the examination on how well model designs correspond to the reality and intuitions. It was assumed that this type of validation should be conducted by external evaluators with no stake in the study. | ‚ùå Not met | Observation of and discussion with medical staff was conducted to get information on each PHC (e.g. patient load) - e.g. `3.1 Generic Modelling Approach and PHC Operational Data Collection`: "these service times were estimated based on discussions with doctors and nurses."<br><br>However, could not find any description of the model designs being reviewed by an external evaluator.<br><br>@shoaib_simulation_2021 |
| 12 Is cross validation performed and reported | ...comparison across similar modeling studies which deal with the same decision problem was undertaken. | N/A | Not provided, but throughout the Introduction, they repeatedly described how there is no or little literature around this, so it is reasonable to assume (based on their introduction) that there might not be similar modeling studies available to compare against. |
| 13 Is external validation performed and reported? | ...the modeler(s) examined how well the model‚Äôs results match the empirical data of an actual event modeled. | N/A | `4.1 Model Validation and Queueing Analysis`: "We were unable to perform external validation of the simulation model by comparing its outcomes to, for example, operational outcomes published in the literature, because we were unable to identify any previously published data in the Indian context regarding PHC operational outcomes such as average outpatient waiting time, utilisation of doctors, staff nurses, etc. However, the outcomes generated by the model for all configurations were in good agreement with those observed during our visits to the PHCs. For example, the waiting times observed for outpatients visiting configuration 1 PHCs were negligible, and the utilisation of all resources, as observed in terms was also well below 50%. In addition, we were able to compare the estimates of time spent waiting in the outpatient queue and doctor‚Äôs utilisation generated by our model to the corresponding estimate obtained from primary data collected from a visit to the primary care unit of a similar public health facility in another district." |
| 14 Is predictive validation performed or attempted? | ...the modeler(s) examined the consistency of a model‚Äôs predictions of a future event and the actual outcomes in the future. If this was not undertaken, it was assessed whether the reasons were discussed. | N/A | This is only relevant to forecasting models |
| **Generalisability and stakeholder involvement** |
| 15 Is the model generalizability issue discussed? | ...the modeler(s) discussed the potential of the resulting model for being applicable to other settings/populations (single/multiple application). | ‚úÖ Fully | `5 Discussion & Conclusions`: "While we conducted limited additional visits to primary healthcare facilities in other districts for collection of data to validate the model and observed similar patterns, generalisation of our observations to PHCs across the diverse and vast health landscape of India must be made with appropriate caution. The generic modelling approach that we have adopted can provide some relief here - given the diversity in the operational configurations of PHCs that we encountered in this district (e.g., compare PHCs 4, 5 and 6 in Table 1), and the fact that the government guidelines for PHC configurations are applicable on a national level, it is likely that one of the configuration models that we have developed will be similar to PHC configurations encountered in other districts across the country."<br><br>@shoaib_simulation_2021 |
| 16 Are decision makers or other stakeholders involved in modeling? | ...the modeler(s) reported in which part throughout the modeling process decision makers and other stakeholders (eg, subject experts) were engaged. | ‚ùå Not met | Did not find any mention of this in the text. |
| 17 Is the source of funding stated? | ...the sponsorship of the study was indicated. | ‚úÖ Fully | In the paper published in Simulation, it has a funding section which states that no specific grant was received for the research. (@shoaib_simulation_2022) |
| 18 Are model limitations discussed? | ...limitations of the assessed model, especially limitations of interest to decision makers, were discussed. | ‚úÖ Fully | `5 Discussion & Conclusions`: "A challenge in developing such simulation models in the Indian context is obtaining adequate access to the facilities under consideration for a sufficiently long period of time to collect data required to fit distributions for every input parameter of the simulation. For instance, given the limited data maintained for inpatient length of stays, we were unable to observe inpatient admissions long enough to collect sufficient data to find the best-fitting distribution for inpatient length of stay. In such cases, we estimated these parameters based on our discussions with key medical personnel. We anticipate that the model will have to be updated when data for these parameters will become available. Further, we note that we have only included resources and operations associated with provision of medical care, and hence have not included maintenance/cleaning personnel, etc."<br><br>@shoaib_simulation_2021 |
