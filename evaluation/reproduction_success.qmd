Table 6 was run with 100 replications as it presents mean and standard deviation results. The remaining items present means and so are only run to 10 replications, since increasing replications should have a fairly minimal impact on the mean, and since running 100 replications is computationally expensive and time consuming, with the number of model variants being explored in the sensitivity analyses.

## Time-to-completion figure

```{python}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.ticker as mtick
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import plotly.express as px

# List of time to complete each item
time_list = [
    [856, 'Table 6'],
    [971, 'Figure 2A'],
    [889, 'Figure 2B'],
    [910, 'Figure 2C'],
    [981, 'Figure 2D'],
    [1002, 'Figure 3A'],
    [1008, 'Figure 3B'],
    [1009, 'Figure 3C'],
    [1012, 'Figure 3D'],
    [1165, 'Figure 4'],
    [1196, 'In-text result 1'],
    [1274, 'In-text result 2'],
    [1383, 'In-text result 3'],
    [1396, 'In-text result 4'],
    # TODO: Update these to actual times once complete
    [np.nan, 'In-text result 5'],
    [1490, 'In-text result 6'],
    [np.nan, 'In-text result 7']]

# Convert to dataframe
times = pd.DataFrame(time_list, columns=['time', 'item'])

# Sort the DataFrame by 'time' to correctly plot the ECDF
times_clean = times.sort_values(by='time').reset_index(drop=True)

# Compute the ECDF values
times_clean['ecdf'] = np.arange(1, len(times_clean) + 1) / len(times_clean) * 100

# Insert the starting point (0, 0) in the ECDF
times_clean.loc[-1] = [0, 'Start', 0]
times_clean.index = times_clean.index + 1
times_clean = times_clean.sort_index()
```

Correctly plot but non-interactive:

```{python}

# Adjust index so it goes 0 2 4 6...
times_original = times_clean.copy()
times_original.index = times_clean.index*2

times_extra = times_clean.copy()
# Get result from row 1 to final, and add another row with np.nan
next_result = times_clean['time'][1:].reset_index(drop=True)
next_result[len(next_result)] = np.nan
# Replace time with those values (i.e. the value from the row below)
times_extra['time'] = next_result
times_extra['item'] = np.nan
# Then adjust index so it goes 1 3 5 7...
times_extra.index = (times_extra.index*2)+1

# Combine (so have alternating rows from each due to odd and even indexes)
plt_times = pd.concat([times_original, times_extra]).sort_index()

# Convert time to hours
plt_times['hours'] = plt_times['time']/60

# Create plot
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.plot(plt_times['hours'], plt_times['ecdf'], marker='.', markevery=2)
plt.xlim(0, 40)
plt.ylim(0, 100)
plt.xlabel('Time elapsed (hours)')
plt.ylabel('Percentage of items reproduced')
ax.yaxis.set_major_formatter(mtick.PercentFormatter())
#ax.grid()
#ax.set_axisbelow(True)
plt.show()
```

Interactive plot but without start and end points:

```{python}
# Create ECDF plot
fig = px.ecdf(times, x='time', markers=True, ecdfnorm='percent',
              hover_data=['time', 'item'])

# Amend appearance
fig.update_layout(xaxis_range=[0, 2400])

# Show plot, hiding toolbar and not allowing zoom
fig.layout.xaxis.fixedrange = True
fig.layout.yaxis.fixedrange = True
fig.show(config={'displayModeBar': False})
```

Interactive plot but connected diagonally:

```{python}
# Create ECDF plot
fig = px.line(times_clean, x='time', y='ecdf', markers=True, 
              hover_data=['time', 'item'])

# Update layout to ensure proper axis ranges
fig.update_layout(xaxis_range=[0, 2400], yaxis_range=[0, 100])

# Show plot, hiding toolbar and not allowing zoom
fig.layout.xaxis.fixedrange = True
fig.layout.yaxis.fixedrange = True
fig.show(config={'displayModeBar': False})
```

## In-text result 1

**Consensus: Successfully reproduced**

**Original:**

From section 4.3: "We also note that waiting times for outpatient-related resources (laboratory, OPD consultation, etc. - not depicted in Figures 3a – 3d) increase marginally because the associated resources are also required by inpatient/childbirth/ANC cases, which increase in number in the above scenarios"

Interpretation:

* Run sensitivity analysis as in Figures 3A-D, but look at outcomes relating to laboratory and outpatient waiting times
* Result: marginal increase

**Reproduction:**

We observed marginal increases (e.g. .1  or 0.01 of a minute).

```{python}
pd.read_csv('../reproduction/outputs/intext1.csv')
```

## In-text result 2

**Consensus: Successfully reproduced**

**Original:**

From section 4.3.1: "To address this, we experimented with letting the staff nurse (whose utilisation is approximately 32%) take over the administrative work. This led to a 12% drop in the utilisation level, which implied that the doctor’s utilisation still exceeded 100%. Implementing this measure resulted in increasing the staff nurse utilisation to nearly 40%."

Interpretation:

* Average patient load of 170 per day
* Average consultation time of 5 min per patient
* Change doctor to have no administrative work, and assign all to staff nurse
* Results: doctor utilisation 103%, staff nurse utilisation nearly 40%

**Reproduction:**

We observe doctor utilisation drop 12% (114% to 102%), and staff nurse utilisation rise from 32% to 40%.

```{python}
pd.read_csv('../reproduction/outputs/intext2.csv')
```

## In-text result 3

**Original:**

From section 4.3.1: "then considered a situation wherein the staff nurses require minimal intervention in childbirth cases. We assumed that in 50% of childbirth cases, staff nurses require no intervention by the doctor; require only one- third of the typical amount of intervention in 30% of cases, and require full intervention in the remaining 20% of cases. This led to a decrease of the doctor’s utilisation to 101% (a further decrease of approximately 1%), and an increase in the nurse’s utilisation to 40%."

Interpretation:

* Average patient load of 170 per day
* Average consultation time of 5 min per patient
* Change doctors from always attending childbirth cases when free to 50% not attending, 30% attending but for one-third of normal time, 20% attending for normal time
* Result: Doctor utilisation 101% and nurse utilisation 40%

**Reproduction:**

The above interpretation was incorrect - this result is obtained by changing the delivery in addition to the admin changes.

Doctor utilisation decreases by a further 1% (102% to 101%). No change in staff nurse utilisation - but remains around 40%, and the original paper describes the nurse utilisation as not changing significantly, and from changing from "nearly 40%" to 40%, so our slight difference from that is very small and likely just model stochasticity and having run 10 replications.

```{python}
pd.read_csv('../reproduction/outputs/intext3.csv')
```

## In-text result 4

**Original:**

From section 4.3.1: "investigated the effect of stationing an additional doctor in the PHC. This yielded an average utilisation of well below 100% for each doctor."

Interpretation:

* Average patient load of 170 per day
* Average consultation time of 5 min per patient
* Add a doctor
* Result: each doctor has utilisation "well below 100%"

**Reproduction:**

The exact parameters of the scenario are ambiguous. However, regardless of whether the additional doctor is alone (as in interpretation above), or in addition to the previous admin and delivery changes (as was the case for in-text result 3), in both cases the doctor utilisation can safely be described as "well below 100%".

```{python}
pd.read_csv('../reproduction/outputs/intext4.csv')
```

## In-text result 5

**Original:**

From section 4.3.2: "We also observe that if the number of beds is reduced to four from six, the utilisation level is observed to be approximately thirty-three percent even under higher demand conditions (two inpatient and childbirth cases/day)."

Interpretation:

* Reduce from six to four inpatient beds
* Conditions un-specified (assume standard, and also high demand (2 inpatient and childbirth cases per day))
* Result: Approximately 33% utilisation

**Reproduction:**

**TBC**

## In-text result 6

**Original:**

From section 4.3.3: "When the administrative work alone is assigned to the staff nurse the average utilisation of the NCD nurse decreases to 100%"

Interpretation:

* Outpatient interarrival time 3 minutes
* No administrative work for NCD nurse, only assigned to staff nurse
* Result: NCD nurse utilisation 100%

**Reproduction:**

NCD nurse utilisation drops from 124% to 100%.

```{python}
pd.read_csv('../reproduction/outputs/intext6.csv')
```

## In-text result 7

**Original:**

From section 4.3.3: "Further, in addition to the administrative work when the staff nurse assisted for NCD checks (for 10% cases) the utilisation of NCD nurse dropped to 71%."

Interpretation:

* Outpatient interarrival time 3 minutes
* Potentially combined with change in administrative work
* Assigned staff nurse for 10% of NCD cases
* Result: NCD nurse utilisation 71%

**Reproduction:**

**TBC**
