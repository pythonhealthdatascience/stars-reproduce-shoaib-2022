## In-text result 1

From section 4.3: "We also note that waiting times for outpatient-related resources (laboratory, OPD consultation, etc. - not depicted in Figures 3a – 3d) increase marginally because the associated resources are also required by inpatient/childbirth/ANC cases, which increase in number in the above scenarios"

Interpretation:

* Run sensitivity analysis as in Figures 3a-d, but look at outcomes relating to laboratory and outpatient consulation
* Result: marginal increase

## In-text result 2

From section 4.3.1: "To address this, we experimented with letting the staff nurse (whose utilisation is approximately 32%) take over the administrative work. This led to a 12% drop in the utilisation level, which implied that the doctor’s utilisation still exceeded 100%. Implementing this measure resulted in increasing the staff nurse utilisation to nearly 40%."

Interpretation:

* Average patient load of 170 per day
* Average consultation time of 5 min per patient
* Change doctor to have no administrative work, and assign all to staff nurse
* Results: doctor utilisation 103%

*103% is because the next result is 1% below, and as there is a 12% drop from fig 2a, still over 100%, and nurse utilisation at 40%*

## In-text result 3

From section 4.3.1: "then considered a situation wherein the staff nurses require minimal intervention in childbirth cases. We assumed that in 50% of childbirth cases, staff nurses require no intervention by the doctor; require only one- third of the typical amount of intervention in 30% of cases, and require full intervention in the remaining 20% of cases. This led to a decrease of the doctor’s utilisation to 101% (a further decrease of approximately 1%), and an increase in the nurse’s utilisation to 40%."

Interpretation:

* Average patient load of 170 per day
* Average consultation time of 5 min per patient
* Change doctors from always attending childbirth cases when free to 50% not attending, 30% attending but for one-third of normal time, 20% attending for normal time
* Result: Doctor utilisation 101% and nurse utilisation 40%

## In-text result 4

From section 4.3.1: "investigated the effect of stationing an additional doctor in the PHC. This yielded an average utilisation of well below 100% for each doctor."

Interpretation:

* Average patient load of 170 per day
* Average consultation time of 5 min per patient
* Add a doctor
* Result: each doctor has utilisation "well below 100%"

## In-text result 5

From section 4.3.2: "We also observe that if the number of beds is reduced to four from six, the utilisation level is observed to be approximately thirty-three percent even under higher demand conditions (two inpatient and childbirth cases/day)."

Interpretation:

* Reduce from six to four inpatient beds
* Conditions un-specified (assume standard, and also high demand (2 inpatient and childbirth cases per day))
* Result: Approximately 33% utilisation

## In-text result 6

From section 4.3.3: "When the administrative work alone is assigned to the staff nurse the average utilisation of the NCD nurse decreases to 100%"

Interpretation:

* Outpatient interarrival time 3 minutes
* No administrative work for NCD nurse, only assigned to staff nurse
* Result: NCD nurse utilisation 100%

:::

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal" collapse=true}

## In-text result 7

From section 4.3.3: "Further, in addition to the administrative work when the staff nurse assisted for NCD checks (for 10% cases) the utilisation of NCD nurse dropped to 71%."

Interpretation:

* Outpatient interarrival time 3 minutes
* Potentially combined with change in administrative work
* Assigned staff nurse for 10% of NCD cases
* Result: NCD nurse utilisation 71%
