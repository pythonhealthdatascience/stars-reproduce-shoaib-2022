## In-text result 1

From section 4.3: "We also note that waiting times for outpatient-related resources (laboratory, OPD consultation, etc. - not depicted in Figures 3a – 3d) increase marginally because the associated resources are also required by inpatient/childbirth/ANC cases, which increase in number in the above scenarios"

## In-text result 2

From section 4.3.1: "To address this, we experimented with letting the staff nurse (whose utilisation is approximately 32%) take over the administrative work. This led to a 12% drop in the utilisation level, which implied that the doctor’s utilisation still exceeded 100%. Implementing this measure resulted in increasing the staff nurse utilisation to nearly 40%."

## In-text result 3

From section 4.3.1: "then considered a situation wherein the staff nurses require minimal intervention in childbirth cases. We assumed that in 50% of childbirth cases, staff nurses require no intervention by the doctor; require only one- third of the typical amount of intervention in 30% of cases, and require full intervention in the remaining 20% of cases. This led to a decrease of the doctor’s utilisation to 101% (a further decrease of approximately 1%), and an increase in the nurse’s utilisation to 40%."

## In-text result 4

From section 4.3.1: "investigated the effect of stationing an additional doctor in the PHC. This yielded an average utilisation of well below 100% for each doctor."
:::

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal" collapse=true}

## In-text result 5

From section 4.3.2: "We also observe that if the number of beds is reduced to four from six, the utilisation level is observed to be approximately thirty-three percent even under higher demand conditions (two inpatient and childbirth cases/day)."

## In-text result 6

From section 4.3.3: "When the administrative work alone is assigned to the staff nurse the average utilisation of the NCD nurse decreases to 100%"
:::

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal" collapse=true}

## In-text result 7

From section 4.3.3: "Further, in addition to the administrative work when the staff nurse assisted for NCD checks (for 10% cases) the utilisation of NCD nurse dropped to 71%."
