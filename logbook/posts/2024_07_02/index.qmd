## Research compendium

Continuing to make changes to repository...

* Tests
    * Got basic functionality of the test working (e.g. running model, saving test result to temporary directory, importing the results files)
    * After exploring a few options, used 'ids' to give more informative name to each test (as otherwise just says fail for `param[0]`, `param[1]`), based on [this help doc](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/example/parametrize.html#different-options-for-test-ids)
    * Add all the reproduction variable dictionaries to `test_model.py`
