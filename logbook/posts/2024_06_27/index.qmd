## Consensus

I emailed Figure 4 and in-text results 1 and 2 to Tom and Alison, who both confirmed that they agreed these to be successfully reproduced.

## 9.22-9.34: In-text result 2

On reflection, I realised that I had not looked at the result for staff nurse utilisation. Add this, and it was consistent with the text. Hence, successfully reproduced at 9.34.

```{python}
import sys
sys.path.append('../')
from timings import calculate_times

# Minutes used prior to today
used_to_date = 1262

# Times from today
times = [
    ('9.22', '9.34')
]

calculate_times(used_to_date, times)
```
