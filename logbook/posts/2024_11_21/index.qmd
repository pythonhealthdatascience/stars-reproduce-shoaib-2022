Redid badge evaluation.

:::

## 09.45-09.57: Revisit evaluation

Revisited and revised the badge criteria to (a) make them up-to-date, and (b) make sure they are *specific* to the descriptions from each badge. Hence, redoing evaluations for all eight studies.

Notes:

* Reproduce: decided no as not 100% (and this is the only main change since the last evaluation, as decided to be clearer/more consistent with reported results, to just have binary yes/no depending on whether 100% or not).

## Untimed: Update summary report

With new badge evaluation results.
