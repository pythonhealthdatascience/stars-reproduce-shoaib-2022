## 10.16-10.35: Set up repository

* Create repository from template
* Set up environment
* Set up site on GitHub pages (`quarto publish gh-pages`)
* Amendments to files to reflect current paper (e.g. author name, citation):
    * `README.md`
    * quarto site `index.qmd`
    * `CITATION.cff`
    * `_quarto.yml`

## 10.41-10.43: Upload code to repository and check license

Model code from: https://github.com/shoaibiocl/PHC-. Downloaded repository and copied folder `PHC--main` into `original_study/`.

They shared under MIT license, so no amendments to our license required.

## 10.44-11.15: Upload journal article to repository and compare between pre-print and published version

Article is published with SIMULATION and is not open access: <https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/00375497211030931> (<https://doi.org/10.1177/00375497211030931>). Button to request reuse takes you to reuse which has charges for reuse.

Searched for green open access version of article and identified pre-print on arxiv: <https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.12492> (<https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2104.12492>). That is shared via [CC BY-NC-ND 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/). This means we can:

* Share the article (inc. the images from the article)
* Must give attribution - appropriate credit, provide link to license, and indicate if changes are made
* ND (NoDerivatives) - so cannot make any modifications to the article or images (inc. e.g. colour changes etc) - *which is fine as don't plan to do so*

As such, saved the article as `preprint.pdf` within `original_study/`.

SIMULATION first published online 18 July 2021. The pre-print was first submit 15 Feb 2021 with second version 21 June 2021 (after the SIMULATION date, hence anticipating should be similar). Glanced between the pre-print and publication in SIMULATION to look for differences:

* Text - broadly looks very similar, spotted one difference ("Next, for assigning ages to outpatients" v.s. "Later, for assigning ages to outpatients"), and so there may be more.
* Tables and figures - contents looked similar, spotted differences:
    * Table 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + C.1 footnotes - more abbreviations provided in SIMULATION paper
    * Formatting differences for tables
    * Figures provided seperately in pre-print (e.g. 2a vs 2b vs 2c vs 2d rather than all as a single figure - although that does make them easier to read when they are seperate)

Embed in `study_publication.qmd` with links.

Some reflections:

* Do I need to do more thorough comparison of content (e.g. software to compare text itself?)
* Images not provided as seperate files, will need to screenshot to upload
* Took a while to do this stage
