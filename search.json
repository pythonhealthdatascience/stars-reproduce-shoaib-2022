I estimated the IAT to be 960, but I also tried using 1080 (which is equidistant between the 1 and 2 arrival IAT values), as I have not identified a formula for how these are produced, and have only been able to estimate.\nFrom comparing the two options, 960 is closer for 2 beds whilst 1080 is closer for 1 bed. Since the difference is greatest for 1 bed, I opted to use that IAT.\n\ncreate_figure4(data_4a)\n# plt.savefig(fig4_path, bbox_inches='tight')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Input results from original and reproduced figures\ncomp = pd.DataFrame({\n    'original': [0.021, 0.039, 0.039, 0.0599, 0.150, 0.195, 0.195, 0.270],\n    'reproduced': data_4a.iloc[:, 1].to_list() + data_4a.iloc[:, 0].to_list()})\ncomp['reproduced'] = round(comp['reproduced'], 3)\n\n# Find size of difference and % change\ncomp['diff'] = comp['reproduced'] - comp['original']\ncomp['pct_change'] = comp.pct_change(axis=1).iloc[:, 1]*100\ncomp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\noriginal\nreproduced\ndiff\npct_change\n\n\n\n\n0\n0.0210\n0.018\n-0.0030\n-14.285714\n\n\n1\n0.0390\n0.037\n-0.0020\n-5.128205\n\n\n2\n0.0390\n0.033\n-0.0060\n-15.384615\n\n\n3\n0.0599\n0.057\n-0.0029\n-4.841402\n\n\n4\n0.1500\n0.148\n-0.0020\n-1.333333\n\n\n5\n0.1950\n0.225\n0.0300\n15.384615\n\n\n6\n0.1950\n0.185\n-0.0100\n-5.128205\n\n\n7\n0.2700\n0.273\n0.0030\n1.111111\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChosen figure (with IAT 1080)\n\n# Drop 960\ndata_4a_final = data_4a.drop(index='1.5 (IAT 960)')\n\n# Amend labels to match original\ndata_4a_final.index = [x.split(' (')[0] for x in data_4a_final.index.to_list()]\n\ncreate_figure4(data_4a_final)\nplt.savefig(fig4_path, bbox_inches='tight')\nplt.show()"

The change was:\n\nbed_util.append(bed_time/(days*1440*6)) to\nbed_util.append(bed_time/(days*1440*delivery_bed_n))\n\nHowever, logically, this looks like it should be right? Since the calculation is days (length of simulation), 1440 (24h in min), and then 6 (the standard number of beds). And itâs working out the proportion of time that beds are utilised, so it makes sense that this six should be the number of beds. Moreover, for the first result, it shouldâve remained the same as before (as delivery_bed_n=6).\nI then realised my mistake! I had input delivery_bed_n when I should have input inpatient_bed_n! And this fixed it!\nReviewing the values, although they are a little lower (3-4%), they do represent a marked increase from the 6 bed values, and so I feel (bearing that in mind), that this difference is minimal enough to consider them successfully reproduced as of 9.47.\n\nimport sys\nsys.path.append('../')\nfrom timings import calculate_times\n\n# Minutes used prior to today\nused_to_date = 1536\n\n# Times from today\ntimes = [\n    ('9.15', '9.25'),\n    ('9.31', '9.41'),\n    ('9.46', '9.47')\n]\n\ncalculate_times(used_to_date, times)\n\nTime spent today: 21m, or 0h 21m\nTotal used to date: 1557m, or 25h 57m\nTime remaining: 843m, or 14h 3m\nUsed 64.9% of 40 hours max"

However, the results for NCD nurse utilisation matched up with the results from the replication results.\nContinued looking over article, code and results to see if I can spot anything, to no avail.\nTried changing the proportion of cases assigned to the staff nurse to see what impact this had (although well aware that text does state that it is 10%, and not more). As expected, the utilisation drops further - here, with 20% of cases assigned, the utilisation dropped to 69% (which is much closer to the original studyâs 71%). However, that doesnât align with how they described the scenario in the text.\n\nimport pandas as pd\n\npd.read_csv('intext7_20.csv')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOutput\nNormal\nAdmin from NCD to staff nurse\n20% OPD appointments from NCD to staff nurse\nAdmin and 20% OPD appointments from NCD to staff nurse\n\n\n\n\n0\nNCD nurse utilisation\n1.237\n1.007\n0.924\n0.689\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI considered changing the arrivals although, realistically, this should be fine, since in-text result 7 just builds on the scenario established in in-text result 6, which matches up to the text, and - as stated in Figure 2B - the doctorâs consultation time should not affect the outcome (so shouldnât need to change that either).\nI kept looking back over everything, but still, could not spot anything. Have emailed Tom and Alison to ask for their thoughts (as well as to get consensus on reproduction of prior items). Iâm not sure if this is necessarily a case for contacting the author or not, given that the scenario appears to have been successfully set up (with utilisation dropping - and dropping further if 20% assigned)."

I double checked the change in NCD nurse utilisation between 10 and 100 replications (got results from Table 6 with 10 replications from old commit, processed and saved it with the logbook post from 24th June). Confirmed it was tiny. However, to rule it out, will re-run over lunch.\nHe suggested otherwise to contact the study authors to let them know weâve been very successful but see if they have any suggestions for this one final thing that we canât quite get to work.\n\nI did a bit of tidying prior to emailing to Shoaib, drafted the email, and ran 100 replications for the final scenario over lunch.\nI also then add the results from setting the help as 20% rather than 10% (modifying the way I set this up in PHC.py so I could easily do so from the notebook).\nI then sent the email to Shoaib. This now marks the end of my work on in-text result 7 (since emailing was part of the troubleshooting for that) - although I may work on this further if we receive a response from Shoaib with any suggestions."

I set this up with a doctor_delivery_scenario parameter in main() and then changes to Delivery().\n# If True for scenario where reduce doctor intervention...\nif doctor_delivery_scenario:\n    # Sample intervention probability (between 0 and 1)\n    int_prob = sim.Uniform(0, 1)\n    # Assign 50% to receive doctor, and 50% to not\n    if int_prob &gt;= 0.5:\n        Delivery_with_doctor(urgent=True)\n    else:\n        Delivery_no_doc(urgent=True)\n# If scenario not in place (i.e. base case, normal function),\n# then just assign all to receive doctor...\nelse:\n    Delivery_with_doctor(urgent=True)\nWhilst doing this, changed comments by inputs to main() into a doc string for clarity as I am often adjusting these.\nFor the cases where a doctor is provided, look to then have 60% receive partial intervention and 40% receive full intervention. In Delivery_with_doctor(), doctor time is sample twice (depending on whether or not the model is in the warm-up period or not). Both as: doc_time = round(sim.Uniform(30, 60, 'minutes').sample(),2). This contributes to doctor utilisation as follows:\n\nPatient.doc_service_time.append(doc_time)\ndoc_tot_time = sum(Patient.doc_service_time)\nz = doc_tot_time/(420*days*doc_cap)\ndoc_occupancy.append(z) - and then doc_occupancy is used to calculate utilisation in the replication results spreadsheet\n\nAs such, I introduced a probability of receiving shorter or longer times around this Uniform sampling. I assumed 1/3 normal intervention to mean that the sampled time is simply divided by three.\n# If we are in a scenario where we are reducing the time spent\n# by doctors during delivery to one third of normal time, for 60%\n# of delivery patients...\nif doctor_delivery_scenario:\n    # Sample to get probability of short intervention\n    short_int_prop = sim.Uniform(0, 1)\n    if short_int_prop &gt;= 0.4:\n        doc_time = doc_time / 3\nHowever, this came back wrong, with very little change in utilisation:\n\nimport pandas as pd\n\npd.read_csv('intext3_wrong.csv')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOutput\nNormal delivery\nReduced doctor intervention\nChange\n\n\n\n\n0\nDoctor utilisation\n1.142\n1.131\n-0.011\n\n\n1\nStaff nurse utilisation\n0.323\n0.321\n-0.002\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReflections\n\n\n\nAs before, time spent working out how to implement scenarios from the article"

When I amended the script to adjust the bed capacity via a parameter input to main(), I had not noticed this, and had only changed it in the simpy Resource. I amended this accordingly and re-ran.

In it, 10% of the NCD cases are assigned to the staff nurse instead of the NCD nurse.\nIn PHC.py, I can see that the NCD nurses do admin and do OPD appointments. The appointments are in the class Patient(), and if OPD_PatientGenerator.OPD_List[OPD_PatientGenerator.patient_count][\"Age\"] &gt;= 30, then it requests an NCD nurse (yield self.request((NCD_Nurse, 1))).

This is likely because most healthcare DES studies are undertaken to help analyse and/or solve specific problems associated with a facility, whereas our study aims to contribute towards establishing the computational infrastructure required to analyse the public health system in a region.â\nâour research contribution here involves the inclusion of limited inpatient care and childbirth care in our PHC models inaddition to modelling general OPD consultations and emergency casesâ\nâour literature search did not yield any study that computationally examined: a) PHC operations, and b) how their operational performance would respond to changes in demand and/or capacity.

In arXiv paper, they are presented quite seperately (although they are put together more in the simulation paper).\nFigure 3 - as for figure 2\nFigure 4 - in scope\n\nResults from the abstract or results section that I canât currently spot as being covered by the tables and figures:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSections quoted from Shoaib and Ramamohan (2021)\nPrecise result to be reproduced\nThoughts on whether to include in scope\n\n\n\n\n4.3 âWe also note that waiting times for outpatient-related resources (laboratory, OPD consultation, etc. - not depicted in Figures 3a â 3d) increase marginally because the associated resources are also required by inpatient/childbirth/ANC cases, which increase in number in the above scenariosâ\nNo - just marginal increase\nNo? Could argue not in scope, as all youâre aiming for is âseeing a marginal increaseâ - but likewise, if you saw the opposite of that, you could argue itâs not being reproduced. However, leaning towards the latter as nothing precise\n\n\n4.3.1 âTo address this, we experimented with letting the staff nurse (whose utilisation is approximately 32%) take over the administrative work. This led to a 12% drop in the utilisation level, which implied that the doctorâs utilisation still exceeded 100%. Implementing this measure resulted in increasing the staff nurse utilisation to nearly 40%.â\nStaff nurse does all administrative work (none to doctor). Look at impact on doctorâs utilisation. When have outpatient load 170 patients per day.\nMaybe? - depends if I have interpreted the described scenario correctly\n\n\n4.3.1 âthen considered a situation wherein the staff nurses require minimal intervention in childbirth cases. We assumed that in 50% of childbirth cases, staff nurses require no intervention by the doctor; require only one- third of the typical amount of intervention in 30% of cases, and require full intervention in the remaining 20% of cases. This led to a decrease of the doctorâs utilisation to 101% (a further decrease of approximately 1%), and an increase in the nurseâs utilisation to 40%.â\n50% childbirth have no doctor. 30% have one-third of typical amount of doctor intervention. 20% have full doctor intervention. Look at doctor and nurse utilisation. Normal doctor attendance described in 3.3.3 is that, if doctor is available, patient is attended by both a doctor and a staff nurse - and if not available, then they attend once available, with first-come first-serve alongside inpatient. In Table 4, can see doctor childbirth service time is from uniform distribution with min 30 max 60.\nYes? Think it might be in scope, and has precise results to reproduce\n\n\n4.3.1 âinvestigated the effect of stationing an additional doctor in the PHC. This yielded an average utilisation of well below 100% for each doctor.â\nNo precise result\nNo? Potentially not as doesnât have a precise result, just âwell below 100%â\n\n\n4.3.2 âWe also observe that if the number of beds is reduced to four from six, the utilisation level is observed to be approximately thirty-three percent even under higher demand conditions (two inpatient and childbirth cases/day).â\nApx. 33% inpatient bed utilisation when there are four bed and there are 2 inpatient and childbirth cases per day\nMaybe? Only gives an approximate result which it says holders âeven under higher demandâ but is not specific to those conditions, and so could be a few percent different or more, depending on interpretation of âapproximateâ. Hence, not sure if precise enough to reproduce.\n\n\n4.3.3 âWhen the administrative work alone is assigned to the staff nurse the average utilisation of the NCD nurse decreases to 100%â\nOutpatient IAT 3 min and administrative work just performed by staff nurse (and not NCD nurse), NCD nurse utilisation 100%\nMaybe? Might be precise enough?\n\n\n4.3.3 âFurther, in addition to the administrative work when the staff nurse assisted for NCD checks (for 10% cases) the utilisation of NCD nurse dropped to 71%.â\nIf 10% cases assigned to staff nurse instead of NCD, when outpatient IAT 3 min, NCD utilisation is 71%\nMaybe? Might be precise enough, assuming Iâve interpreted scenario correctly?\n\n\n\nAppendix C - not relevant, focused on validation."

The paper states they run 100, but that takes ages, and so Iâve taken the approach that - if it seems reasonably similar enough with 10 replications - Iâm happy with it at this point. For posterity, can run all with 100 now or at the end if desired. As these just present mean results, I would only expect it to have a fairly minimal impact for mean of 10 v.s. 100 replications. For Table 6, I did run 100 replications as it was mean and SD.\nHowever, this is not correct:\n\nRealised this was my mistake and I had mis-interpreted it as adding 1 or 2 extra beds, but instead, it was simply having 1 or 2 beds in total. Upon re-reading the text again, this was definitely my mistake and not the article. Upon amending this, the figure looks much closer.\n\nI was reasonably confident in this being correct, but anticipate the differences here would likely be resolved by doing 100 replications rather than 10. As such, tried running more replications (25 still instead of 100 due to time). Notebook run time 7m 16s.\nThis brought the result closer, although still some small differences.\n\nAs the figure is labelled, I can compare the numbers:\n\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Input results from original and reproduced figures\ncomp = pd.DataFrame({\n    'original': [0.021, 0.039, 0.0599, 0.150, 0.195, 0.270],\n    'reproduced': [0.019, 0.036, 0.060, 0.157, 0.218, 0.276]})\n\n# Find size of difference and % change\ncomp['diff'] = comp['reproduced'] - comp['original']\ncomp['pct_change'] = comp.pct_change(axis=1).iloc[:, 1]*100\ncomp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\noriginal\nreproduced\ndiff\npct_change\n\n\n\n\n0\n0.0210\n0.019\n-0.0020\n-9.523810\n\n\n1\n0.0390\n0.036\n-0.0030\n-7.692308\n\n\n2\n0.0599\n0.060\n0.0001\n0.166945\n\n\n3\n0.1500\n0.157\n0.0070\n4.666667\n\n\n4\n0.1950\n0.218\n0.0230\n11.794872\n\n\n5\n0.2700\n0.276\n0.0060\n2.222222\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTheyâre very similar, and the only difference Iâm uncertain about is 1 bed with 1.5 arrivals, as the actual size of the difference is 0.023 (19.5% referred elsewhere v.s. 21.8% referred elsewhere).\nHowever, I think it is honestly pretty similar, and given that all the other points are very close. I tried running with 10 replications again to see if it looked particularly different, but came out as 0.221.\nSince everything else looks right, I guessed it could potentially be related to the IAT used for 1.5 births. Although Iâm pretty confident in my estimated value, I decided to try running it with a different IAT - just using a value equidistant between 720 and 1440. When I did this, we got a much closer result for the 1 bed, but a more different result for the 2 bed, for 1.5 births.\n\nI again decided to try upping this to 25 replications to see if that has an impact.\n\nDue to the differing results observed, I decided to run both IATs for 100 replications and use the results from that that best matched the original paper. However, this was heating up the computer and VS Code crashed at 80 replications (before any results are saved). I then tried 25 replications, but this experienced an error and seemed to get stuck running one of the models after that -\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/home/amy/mambaforge/envs/shoaib2022/lib/python3.9/site-packages/salabim/salabim.py\", line 4784, in step\n    next(c._process)\n  File \"/home/amy/Documents/stars/stars-reproduce-shoaib-2022/reproduction/PHC.py\", line 290, in process\n    yield self.hold(sim.Normal(5,1).bounded_sample())\n  File \"/home/amy/mambaforge/envs/shoaib2022/lib/python3.9/site-packages/salabim/salabim.py\", line 12058, in hold\n    self._reschedule(scheduled_time, priority, urgent, \"hold\")\n  File \"/home/amy/mambaforge/envs/shoaib2022/lib/python3.9/site-packages/salabim/salabim.py\", line 11827, in _reschedule\n    raise ValueError(\"scheduled time ({:0.3f}) before now ({:0.3f})\".format(scheduled_time, self.env._now))\nValueError: scheduled time (91194.770) before now (91195.054)\nAs that had taken 15 minutes and also alot of compute power, I decided to go with the simplest approach: to run again but with 10 replications, as I have done for prior figures (for consistency with prior figures, and as I know from experimenting between 10 and 25 replications, that often this only has a fairly small impact on the mean values observed).\nI then chose the IAT which produced results closest to the original paper (based on the assumption that the original authors might have reasonably used either value, since it is not provided and since I do not know the method used to estimate these).\nAt 13.38, decided this was successfully reproduced.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReflections\n\n\n\nFound it a bit tricky to work out to go from number of arrivals to inter-arrival rate. Still not quite sure on how, beyond making estimates based on provided arrivals and IAT.\nModels that take a long time to run are a bit trickier to work with as it limits what you can do while you wait\nHave assumed here that potentially the result might be from two IAT (cannot guarnatee that to be the case, but is what enabled me to get more consistent results with original paper). Regardless of what is true in this case (as we cannot necessarily know), a learning here is that if you do directly change parameters in a script for scenarios, it potentially leaves more margin for error than if it is done programmatically.\n\n\n\nimport sys\nsys.path.append('../')\nfrom timings import calculate_times\n\n# Minutes used prior to today\nused_to_date = 1012\n\n# Times from today\ntimes = [\n    ('9.31', '9.49'),\n    ('10.04', '10.50'),\n    ('11.01', '11.48'),\n    ('11.56', '12.02'),\n    ('12.50', '12.56'),\n    ('13.08', '13.38')\n]\n\ncalculate_times(used_to_date, times)\n\nTime spent today: 153m, or 2h 33m\nTotal used to date: 1165m, or 19h 25m\nTime remaining: 1235m, or 20h 35m\nUsed 48.5% of 40 hours max"

The variant introduced is to give all administrative work to the staff nurse. This is not something that can currently be modified in main().\nThe class Main() mentions this, \"For sensitivity analysis. Admin work added to staff nurse rather than doctor\", but it is not clear what to modify in that section to change assignment of admin work.\nI worked through how admin work is generated and used throughout the scriptâ¦\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow admin work is generated and used\n\n\n\n\n\nThe script explains that the arrival of admin work is generated within Main(). It is generated by:\nk = int(sim.Normal(100,20).bounded_sample(60,140))\nIf it is not warmup, then k is used as follows:\nPatient.doc_service_time.append(k)\nMain.NCD_admin_work.append(k)\nncd_time += k\nDoc_service_time\nThe doc_service_time is composed of several times in a list (Patient.doc_service_time.append(doc_time), Patient.doc_service_time.append(total)) that are sum to find doc_tot_time (total time during 365 days) (doc_tot_time = sum(Patient.doc_service_time)).\nNCD_admin_work\nNCD_admin_work is add to sumi (for i in Main.NCD_admin_work: sumi += i) then cleared (Main.NCD_admin_work = []). sumi is:\n\nAdd to total_admin_work which is add to NCD nurse time and used to calculate Total_NCD_time.\n\nThat is add to NCD_occ_list, which is used in both results spreadsheets to find NCD nurse utilisation.\n\nUsed to calculate doctor admin time in the large results spreadsheet (whilst doctor admin time is not included in the replication results spreadsheet).\nUsed to calculate NCD nurse OPD time for the large results spreadsheet\n\nncd_time\nncd_time is composed of k (sampled admin work) and x (related to patient OPD visits). It is appended to ncd_util (ncd_util.append(ncd_time/(420*365))). ncd_util is the second NCD occ in the replication results spreadsheet. This row contains duplicate results with another NCD occ, and that row is based on NCD_occ_list (as mentioned above).\n\n\n\nAfter this, I understood that admin work was currently given to both the doctor and the NCD nurse - and therefore, the change would be to add it to the staff nurse instead of the doctor in that else statement (which is as mentioned in that comment in the script, but wasnât clear to me upon first looking).\nThe doctor admin time is add via Patient.doc_service_time.append(k).\nLooking at the replication results spreadsheet, staff nurse occ is nurse_occ_list.\nThat list is created from nurse_occ_list.append((sum(Main.NT_list)+180*days)/(21*60*days)).\nThe NT_list is the nurse time list. It is created from Main.NT_list.append(temp) (which occurs several times in the script). In each case, temp refers to a sampled time (e.g.Â temp = sim.Uniform(120, 240, 'minutes').sample(), temp = sim.Triangular(8, 20.6, 12.3).sample()).\nAs such, I think that we should be able to add the admin work to the nurse time by appending k to NT_list. I amended PHC.py to enable input of a boolean to main() that adjusts who receives that time in Main().\nI observed a decrease in utilisation of 12% (114% utilisation to 102%).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReflections\n\n\n\nMaking it clear and easy to modify the model - as least, for the variants presented in the paper. In this case, challenging to identify how to re-allocate admin tasks."

For example, from the Introduction: â¢ The model âcan provide researchers and analysts in other countries with similar hierarchical public health systems with a template for developing models of similar primary/secondary healthcare facilitiesââ¢ âWe found very limited work that utilises a generic modelling approach for simulating primary healthcare delivery facilities that handle multiple patient types (with distinct clinical and operational flows through multiple facility units) and services (the PHC provides outpatient care, childbirth, antenatal services, limited inpatient care, pharmacy and clinical laboratory services). Thus, another key research contribution of this study involves addressing the above research gap.âShoaib and Ramamohan (2021)\n\n\n1.2 Model outputs\nDefine all quantitative performance measures that are reported, using equations where necessary. Specify how and when they are calculated during the model run along with how any measures of error such as confidence intervals are calculated.\nð¡ Partially\nA few example measures are mentioned in the Introduction: âOperational outcomes such as the average waiting time of patients for various resources (e.g., doctors, pharmacy, clinical laboratory), resource utilisation levels across the PHC, and the proportions of childbirth patients who wait longer than a certain time threshold.âIn Table 6, a few measures are briefly defined - e.g.Â âMean length of pharmacy queue (number of patients)â. However, many measures are not defined.Shoaib and Ramamohan (2021)\n\n\n1.3 Experimentation aims\nIf the model has been used for experimentation, state the objectives that it was used to investigate.(A) Scenario based analysis â Provide a name and description for each scenario, providing a rationale for the choice of scenarios and ensure that item 2.3 (below) is completed.(B) Design of experiments â Provide details of the overall design of the experiments with reference to performance measures and their parameters (provide further details in data below).(C) Simulation Optimisation â (if appropriate) Provide full details of what is to be optimised, the parameters that were included and the algorithm(s) that was be used. Where possible provide a citation of the algorithm(s).\nâ Fully\nScenarios were sufficiently described throughout that I was able to reproduce (although language could be a little bit ambiguous in some places).Example of scenario description from 4.3.1 Doctor's Utilisation: âThe sensitivity analyses reveal that at an average outpatient load of 170 patients per day, the utilisation of doctors increases substantially with increases in the mean service time and exceeds 100% at an average consultation time of five minutes/patient, implying that doctors may stay longer than the designated working hours to serve all patients arriving within the designated working hours. To address this, we experimented with letting the staff nurse (whose utilisation is approximately 32%) take over the administrative work. This led to a 12% drop in the utilisation level, which implied that the doctorâs utilisation still exceeded 100%.âShoaib and Ramamohan (2021)\n\n\nLogic\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1 Base model overview diagram\nDescribe the base model using appropriate diagrams and description.

If reneging, balking or jockeying occur, etc., provide details of the rules. Detail any delays or capacity constraints on the queues.\nâ Fully\nDescribed in 3.3 Patient Flow - for example, 3.3.2 Inpatient Department: âinpatients have nonpreemptive priority in comparison to outpatients with regard to consulting with the doctor â that is, if the doctor is busy with an outpatient when an inpatient arrives, the inpatient moves to the head of the outpatient queue. The doctor then attends to the inpatient once they are finished consulting with the outpatientâ\n\n\n2.5.5 Components - entry/exit points\nGive details of the model boundaries i.e.Â all arrival and exit points of entities.

The warm-up period, per usual simulation practice, was run with the same set of patient arrival and service rates as in the steady state period (see Table 3 and Table 4). The duration of the warm-up period was chosen to allow a sufficient amount of time for the simulation outcomes to achieve steady state.âShoaib and Ramamohan (2021)\n\n\n4.2 Run length\nDetail the run length of the simulation model and time units.\nâ Fully\nRun length in 4 Simulation Experiments and Results: âThe simulation was run for 365 days, with a warm-up period of 180 daysâThroughout the paper, mentions the time unit (minutes)Shoaib and Ramamohan (2021)\n\n\n4.3 Estimation approach\nState the method used to account for the stochasticity: For example, two common methods are multiple replications or batch means. Where multiple replications have been used, state the number of replications and for batch means, indicate the batch length and whether the batch means procedure is standard, spaced or overlapping. For both procedures provide a justification for the methods used and the number of replications/size of batches.\nð¡ Partially\nStates but does not justify the number of replications in 4 Simulation Experiments and Results: âResults from 100 replication runs were collected for all computational experimentsâShoaib and Ramamohan (2021)\n\n\nImplementation\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1 Software or programming language\nState the operating system and version and build number.State the name, version and build number of commercial or open source DES software that the model is implemented in.State the name and version of general-purpose programming languages used (e.g.Â Python 3.5).Where frameworks and libraries have been used provide all details including version numbers.\nð¡ Partially\nStates the IDE, programming language and simulation software.

For example, the waiting times observed for outpatients visiting configuration 1 PHCs were negligible, and the utilisation of all resources, as observed in terms was also well below 50%. In addition, we were able to compare the estimates of time spent waiting in the outpatient queue and doctorâs utilisation generated by our model to the corresponding estimate obtained from primary data collected from a visit to the primary care unit of a similar public health facility in another district.â\n\n\n14 Is predictive validation performed or attempted?\nâ¦the modeler(s) examined the consistency of a modelâs predictions of a future event and the actual outcomes in the future.

The generic modelling approach that we have adopted can provide some relief here - given the diversity in the operational configurations of PHCs that we encountered in this district (e.g., compare PHCs 4, 5 and 6 in Table 1), and the fact that the government guidelines for PHC configurations are applicable on a national level, it is likely that one of the configuration models that we have developed will be similar to PHC configurations encountered in other districts across the country.âShoaib and Ramamohan (2021)\n\n\n16 Are decision makers or other stakeholders involved in modeling?\nâ¦the modeler(s) reported in which part throughout the modeling process decision makers and other stakeholders (eg, subject experts) were engaged.\nâ Not met\nDid not find any mention of this in the text.\n\n\n17 Is the source of funding stated?\nâ¦the sponsorship of the study was indicated.\nâ Fully\nIn the paper published in Simulation, it has a funding section which states that no specific grant was received for the research.

For instance, given the limited data maintained for inpatient length of stays, we were unable to observe inpatient admissions long enough to collect sufficient data to find the best-fitting distribution for inpatient length of stay. In such cases, we estimated these parameters based on our discussions with key medical personnel. We anticipate that the model will have to be updated when data for these parameters will become available. Further, we note that we have only included resources and operations associated with provision of medical care, and hence have not included maintenance/cleaning personnel, etc.âShoaib and Ramamohan (2021)"

Had to identify which spreadsheet and metric to use, as well as add some outputs that were missing.\nProgrammatically changing parameter values - had to modify script to remove some hard-coded parameters, and to allow parameters to modified by a second script (rather than needing to directly change the model code)\nReplications and run time - due to slow model run time, set up parallel processing and reduced the number of replications\nIdentifying parameters for each scenario - the configuration parameters were mostly provided in a table, whilst the scenarios were largely described in the text. It took some time to identify the parameters/context of each scenario, particuarly as there were sometimes discrepancies, and as some scenarioes were quite ambiguous and I initially misunderstood them\nEstimating parameters - had to estimate/guess some inter-arrival times and consultation boundaries, as they were not provided, and a method to calculate them was not provided\nWriting code to create tables and figures\nWorking out how to change the model for each scenario - for several scenarios, it took some time looking through the model code to understand how I needed to change it to implement a scenario\n\n\nTable 6Figure 2AFigure 2BFigure 2CFigure 2DFigure 3AFigure 3BFigure 3CFigure 3DFigure 4In-text result 1In-text result 2In-text result 3In-text result 4In-text result 5In-text result 6In-text result 7\n\n\nTable 6. âOperational outcomes for each PHC configuration simulation. * Number of doctors/OPD cases/IPD cases/childbirth/ANC (patients)/inpatient beds/labour roomâ Shoaib and Ramamohan (2021)\n \n\n\nFigure 2a. âImpact on doctorâs utilisation.â Shoaib and Ramamohan (2021)\n \n\n\nFigure 2b. âImpact on the NCD nurseâs utilisation.â Shoaib and Ramamohan (2021)\n \n\n\nFigure 2c. âImpact on the average waiting time (minutes) in the OPDâ.

    "text": "What would have helped facilitate this reproduction?\nProvide environment (packages and versions)\n\nNot all packages needed will be listed in the imports (e.g.Â greenlet, pathlib)\nDidnât work with latest package versions, had to backdate it for it to work\nStruggled making environment due to confusion around base package statistics, which had mixed up with one that can be imported from conda/pypi\nTime consuming (apx. 1h30 exc. computation time)\n\nMake clear results with all outputs\n\nSpent some time comparing two alternative results spreadsheets, which had slightly different results for the same metrics, which was a little confusing\nAlso, the same spreadsheet sometimes had duplicate metrics (either with the same or differing results), which again, could be a bit confusing\nHad to add some outputs and calculations (e.g.Â proportion of childbirth cases referred, standard deviation)\n\nWrite the model so it can be modified programmatically and avoid hard-coded values\n\nThis is so you donât have to directly change parameters in the script itself.\nMakes it easier for reproduction to run multiple versions of the model using the same script\nMakes hidden errors less likely (e.g.Â if miss changing a parameter somewhere, or input the wrong parameters and donât realise)\nAlso, makes it easier for scenario analyses, to spot where need to change hard-coded values\n\nTry to improve speed of model where possible\n\nSlow run time meant I introduced parallel processing for the model variants, and generally only ran 10 rather than 100 replications\n\nGive all parameters for a given scenario in a single table\n\nFor example, initially didnât realise that had to change consultation boundaries as well as mean and standard deviation, as this is not listed in Table 4 (although is in the text)\nCan be difficult to identify parameters for the scenarios if they are not provided in a table or in the script, but are only described in the article\nThere were some discrepancies in the parameters of the scenarios between the main text of the article and the tables and figures. This couldâve been helped by more comprehensive tables or outlines of the parameters for each configuration and scenario, so that you werenât having to rely on combining the text and tables/figures.\nSome parameters that could not be calculated were not provided - ie. what consultation boundaries to use when mean length of doctor consultation was 2.5 minutes\nSome scenarios were quite ambiguous/unclear from their description in the text, and I initially misunderstood the required parameters for the scenarios\n\nExplain how to calculate parameters, if not provided\n\nWas unclear how to estimate inter-arrival time (when only provided number of arrivals)\n\nProvide code to process results into tables and/or figures\n\nIt took a little bit of time to create the tables and figures from scratch, making them visually similar to the original article\n\nProvide code for scenarios\n\nThere were several instances where it took quite a while to understand how and where to modify the code in order to run scenarios (e.g.Â no arrivals, transferring admin work, reducing doctor intervention in deliveries)\n\nReduce duplication of code\n\nThe model often contained very similar code before or after warm-up. This has the potential to introduce mistakes - with a suspected (although unconfirmed) mistake being that the lower boundary for the doctor consultation times in configuration 1 differed before and after warm-up.\n\nIncluding tick marks/grid lines on axes\n\nThis is so it is easier to read across and judge where a result is above or below a certain Y value\n\nBonus: Ease of seeds in salabim\n\nThis wasnât necessary for the reproduction due to the replication number, but I wanted to note that a great facilitator to this work was the ease of setting a seed with salabim package. I only had to change one line of code to then get consistent results between runs (unlike other simulation software like SimPy where you have to consider the use of seeds by different sampling functions). Moreover, by default, salabim would have set a seed (this was just overwridden by choice of original authors)."

(2)\nAdd pathlib to environment (2)\nSalabim not working. Tried installing Pillow. Then realised mistake was that statistics on conda/PyPi is an import to allow it to work with 2.7, but actually, statistics is a built-in python module that was introduced in Python 3.4. (2)\nDeleted statistics and rebuilt environment, which worked fine but several more recent packages than paper, but left for now (2)\nAdd greenlet to environment (required from salabim documentation) (2)\nWasnât working, so rebuilt environment with older versions like Iâd planned originally, and it worked fine! So probably wouldâve worked fine to begin with (with addition of pathlib and greenlet), if Iâd not included statistics (2)\nAdd xlrd and pandas to environment so can import the .xls files produced and process them, and openpyxl so could import .xlsx (although understand that these werenât previously in environment as the provided code did not process the results) (2)\n\nThis was time consuming - approximate time (exc. long conda computation time for solving environment):\n\n\nTime spent today: 89m, or 1h 29m\nTotal used to date: 89m, or 1h 29m\n\n\n\n\nResults spreadsheets\n\nDefault is to produce results with a hard coded name in main folder - modified code so this goes to an outputs/ folder and has a specified file name (2)\nScript had code to produce two results spreadsheets: Outputs.xlsx (replication spreadsheet, which was active) and Config_3(2).xlsx (full average results spreadsheet, which was disabled). Spent some time comparing results between these spreadsheets, finding they had different labels and sometimes missing certain results. The results also did not exactly match (when comparing base configuration 1) but all were likely due to rounding differences. Later inspection of the code revealed some were created consistently, and some results were calculated differently, between the spreadsheets. One was also missing standard deviation. Made a choice to use one of the spreadsheets rather than the other. (2)\nHad to add proportion of childbirth cases referred (2)\nThe replication spreadsheet had two OPD queue length outputs with differing results, with only one being based on the list of OPD patients (waitingline_OPD), whilst the other was based on a list of delivery patients (an_list) (3)\nHad to add standard deviation (3)\nThe replication spreadsheet also had two inpatient bed utilisation metrics (one calculated manually, and one based on a Salabim Resource value)\n\n\n\nProgrammatically changing the parameter values\n\nModified the main() function so that the parameters provided to that functions are inputs, so that it can be run and parameters changed from a seperate script. (2)\nConfirming that global variables were still operating as expected, following my changes to the code. (3)\n\n\n\nReplications\n\nPaper lists 100 replications, but script (for which all other parameters match up with configuration 1) is set up to run with 10 replications (2)\nTakes a very long time to run 100, and since results look so similar to with 10, largely only ran 10 replications (with exception of first item, Table 6) (4)\nThese were very slow to run, so set up parallel processing to run the model variants. (4)\nChanged Table 6 to also run 10 replications (8)\n\n\n\nDiscrepancies in the article\n\nConfiguration 4 stated 4 nurses in table but 5 nurses in the text (deduced should be 4, since described as working consecutive 8 hour shifts) (3)\nTable 3 caption describes all configurations as 6 inpatient and 1 labour bed, whilst Table 6 describes configuration 3 as 0 labour beds, but since no labour arrival, has no impact on results. (3)\nDifferences in the number of arrivals for each configuration between Table 6 and section 3.3.1 (e.g.Â 125 v.s. 130). As inter-arrival times were provided for these (and we use that rather than number of arrivals), this didnât have an impact. (3)\n\n\n\nEstimating IAT\n\nWas unclear how to get the IAT, when only the number of arrivals is provided, and had to make rough estimates for these based on the know IAT and arrival numbers (3,5)\nFor Figure 4, the estimate I was confident in did not reproduce results, but an estimate I didnât think would be right did! (5)\n\n\n\nConsultation boundaries\n\nDidnât initially realise I needed to change the consultation lower boundary, as well as the mean and standard deviation for the appointment, as this was not listed in Table 4 (but is in the text) (3)\nNoticed that the original PHC.py script had two different boundaries before and after warm-up. Not certain if this was intentional or not, but left as is. (3)\nDid not provide consultation boundaries to use when mean is 2.5, so had to guess these. (4)\n\n\n\nCreating tables and/or figures\n\nFor each result, had to manually produce the table and/or figure as no code was provided for this (2,3,4)\n\n\n\nAmbiguous/unclear scenarios\nFor each scenario, I had to identify the required parameters from the text. This was often relatively straightforward, although in some cases, it was less so -\n\nFor Figure 2C, initially misunderstood which consultation times to use (4)\nFor Figure 4, initially misunderstood this as adding 1 or 2 extra beds, rather than being a totaly of 1 or 2 beds (5)\nFor in-text result 3, initially misunderstood the change in doctor intervention as being seperate from the admin change, rather than in addition to the admin change (6)\nFor in-text result 4, it was likely unclear if the additiona of a doctor was seperate or in addition to prior changes (although regardless, the result worked out, as just needed to be utiliation âwell below 100%â) (6)\n\n\n\nWorking out how to change the model to add the scenarios\n\nConfiguration has no arrivals, and was unclear how to set this in the model. Tried giving high IAT but was getting 1 antenatal arrival with every run. Instead, set ANC() and Delivery as True/False in main(), which then successfully prevented arrivals. (3)\nFor in-text result 2, spent a while understanding how admin work was generated and use, so I knew how to add code that transfers it to the nurse. It was initially challenging to identify how to reallocate these tasks. (5)\nLikewise, for in-text result 3, it took a while to understand how and where to change the code to modify the doctorâs intervention in delivery cases. (6)\nFor in-text result 5 and 7, it took a while to identify where I needed to change the script to get consistent results. For result 5, I initially made a mistake when modifying the script, replacing hard-coded values with delivery_bed_n when I shouldâve replaced them with inpatient_bed_n (6,7)\n\n\n\nWhether scenario parameters reported are correct\n\nFor in-text 7, I was unable to reproduce results, without changing the scenario from a change of 10% cases transferred to 20% cases transferred. Although we cannot be sure whether this was definitely the answer - or whether there is anything wrong elsewhere. (7)\n\n\n\nSeeds\n\nAdd seed so get consistent results between runs (since was not needed to assess reproduction success, added during research compendium stage) (8)"

Then ran import salabim as sim, but this returned the same error as before just upon import.\nCurrent salabim documentation lists a few different imports that might be required. Went to old documentation on their GitHub, to the 20.0.4 branch then PDF with documentation (which is 20.0.3, but likewise if you go to 20.0.5 branch): https://github.com/salabim/salabim/blob/20%2C0%2C4/salabim.pdf. Then ran:\npip install Pillow\nWhich didnât have much impact. Error message seems to relate to collections not having UserList. Collections is a built-in module in base python. Tried to just import collections (which was fine), then run collections.UserList which returns same error.\nLooking at documentation for Python 2.7.18, collections does not yet have UserList, but it does from 3.0.\nHave realised mistake - that statistics on conda/PyPi is an import to allow it to work with 2.7, but actually, statistics is a built-in python module that was introduced in Python 3.4.\nAs such, deleted environment and removed statistics from the requirements, and just set requirement of Python 3.9 (as tried before) and built using mamba.\nEnvironment prior:\nname: shoaib2022\nchannels:\n  - defaults\ndependencies:\n  - ipykernel=4.10.0\n  - matplotlib=2.2.3\n  - numpy=1.16.6\n  - pathlib=1.0.1\n  - pip=19.3.1\n  - python=2.7\n  - statistics=1.0.3.5\n  - xlsxwriter=1.3.7\n  - xlwt=1.3.0\n  - pip:\n    - salabim==20.0.4\nEnvironment tried now:\nname: shoaib2022\nchannels:\n  - defaults\ndependencies:\n  - ipykernel\n  - matplotlib\n  - numpy\n  - pathlib\n  - pip\n  - python=3.9\n  - xlsxwriter\n  - xlwt\n  - pip:\n    - salabim\nRun:\nconda deactivate\nconda remove -n shoaib2022 --all\nmamba env create -f environment.yml\nconda activate shoaib2022\nThis quickly installed, and updated environment file with the versions it used:\nname: shoaib2022\nchannels:\n  - defaults\ndependencies:\n  - ipykernel=6.28.0\n  - matplotlib=3.8.4\n  - numpy=1.26.4\n  - pathlib=1.0.1\n  - pip=24.0\n  - python=3.9.19\n  - xlsxwriter=3.1.1\n  - xlwt=1.3.0\n  - pip:\n    - salabim==24.0.6\nCan see that several of these are more recent that would have been possible for the paper. But trying import of salabim now works.

Amended paths in these scripts, e.g.Â the location of outputs/ to ../outputs for when importing or saving results.\nAdd seed so we get consistent results between runs\n\nBy default, Salabim sets random seed 1234567, but the study authors had set sim.Environment(trace=False, random_seed='', time_unit='minutes'), which we know from the documentation means no reseeding.\nAs we want to enable reproducible results between runs (for writing up the results obtained, and for testing), modified PHC.py to set seed to 42 in environment.\nI ran one of the notebooks twice and observed no change in the results between those runs, confirming this had been set up easily and successfully.\nNote: Set suggestion to implement seeds during reproduction stage in the protocol, although this is focused on being able to compare your results to the original, and needing a seed if it varies too much to do so. In this case, since the number of replications was sufficient to observe minimal variation, I did not implement at that stage, and instead add them now.\nHowever, then realised I had forgot to change the seed between replications, and so was just getting the sample result for every replication. As such, modified seed so it increments with each replication (as replications are run in PHC.py using a for loop). Re-ran notebook twice and confirmed there was no change.\n\nChanged Table 6 to run to 10 replications, alike the other outcomes, as this is simpler for reproduction and as we know that there are relatively minimal differences between 10 and 100 replications (as you can see from commit 59f6ada).\nRun notebooks using single command\n\nTried running nbconvert from command line or Makefile, but fails to use environment, returning ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'salabim'\nTried downgrading nbconvert but issue persists\nTried setting jupyter interpreter in VSCode settings, and that said I needed to install package notebook\nThen, realised I needed to add it as a kernel for jupyter (so it would appear when run jupyter kernelspec list). Did so by running source activate shoaib2022, python -m ipykernel install --user --name shoaib2022, then source deactivate\nSet this up in a bash script (to add the kernel each time (otherwise it canât seem to find it, despite being in the kernelspec list), and to then execute the notebooks using nbconvert)\n\nTidy up notebooks\n\nAdd the result being reproduced to the start of each notebook, so it is easier to reference to it\nRe-ran all using the bash script, to ensure all have been run with the seeds\n\nCreate tests\n\nInitially explored exporting each dict_list from the reproduction notebooks using pickle (with open('saved_dictionary.pkl', 'wb') as f: pickle.dump(dictionary, f)). However, decided this was then contrary to the principles of testing, where want to be defining each parameter used in the test, so instead set this up manually for each configuration."

Some discrepancies:\n\nConfiguration 4 (benchmark) is stated as 4 nurses in the table, but in the text, is described as having 5 nurses (1 NCD and 4 staff) - although the staff nurses are described as working alone in consecutive 8 hour shifts, which would work out to 3 nurses, so it is assumed that the standard configuration of 3 staff nurse and 1 NCD nurse (and so 4 nurses overall, as in the table) is used.\nTable 3 caption describes all configurations as having 6 inpatient and 1 labour bed - whilst Table 6 describes configuration 3 as having 0 labour room beds. However, as there is no labour arrivals, this has no impact on results, so just left as default 1 bed as per Table 3.\n\nConfiguration 3 has no arrivals for childbirth or ANC, and so Table 3 states their inter-arrival time as NaN. However, it was unclear how to set this up in the model code.\nTrying to figure how best to re-run the PHC.py script given it is set up with global variables.

Then run the model again, and check the values are the same\nHe also suggested, for when there are no arrivals for two patient types, the simplest way to set this up is to set the inter-arrival time to something really really large (e.g.Â 10,000,000 * run time)\n\nI created a function to return global values:\ndef return_globals():\n    \"\"\"\n    Return global variables and their values from workspace.

See GitHub commit 892cca4. This came out looking the same as my other run (e.g.Â doctor utilisation around 0.31 instead of 1.14).\nHence, wondered if the issue was in parameterising of model, so looked back over the paper.

    "text": "16.13-17.00: Starting on Figure 2A-D\nFigure 2 presents results from sensitivity analysis of configuration 1.\nIt varies:\n\nNumber of outpatients per day:\n\n170 (same as config 4) = OPD IAT 3\n85\n65\n\nAverage service time for outpatients - mean (SD):\n\n0.87 (0.21) (same as config 1)\n2.5 (0.5)\n5 (1)\n\n\nIt states that âestimation of the outpatient arrival rate for this configuration is described in detail in Section 3.3.1â. Hence, looked back at provided times and patient counts in the Tablesâ¦\n\nConfig 1: 130 arrivals in a day and IAT of 4\nConfig 2/3: 60 arrivals in a day and IAT of 9\nConfig 4: 170 arrivals in a day and IAT of 3\n\nIn order to get those times:\n\nprint((60/4)*8.6666666666666666666666666666666)\nprint((60/9)*9)\nprint((60/3)*8.5)\n\n130.0\n60.0\n170.0\n\n\nCan see that, in order to get each of the times, the hours per day vary from 8.5 to 9. As such, it is unclear how I should calculate IAT for 85 and 65 per day, due to this variation. It is assumed that this is likely related to rounding?\nThen looked to section 3.3.1 about this in the paper, Shoaib and Ramamohan (2021):\n\nâThe average interarrival times (and consequently the average number of patients) at each configuration were estimated in the following manner. The number of outpatients visiting configuration 1 PHCs (PHCs 1, 5, and 9) range from 80 to 150 patients per day. These include patients visiting for the first time for a given case of illness as well as patients visiting for follow-up consultations on a previous case. Thus we assumed that approximately 125 patients visit on a given day for these PHC configurations, which include 90 first-visit patients, 20% patients on their first follow-up, and 10% visiting for their second follow-up, yield approximately 126 patients. Therefore, the interarrival time of 4 minutes at configuration 1 PHCs corresponds to first-time visits, with follow-up visits scheduled at the same time on any day between the next 3 and 8 days.â\n\nThese values differ from the table - so looking again with these:\n\nConfig 1: 125 or 126 arrivals and IAT 4\nConfig 2/3: 55 arrivals and IAT 9\n\n\nprint((60/4)*8.33333333333333333)\nprint((60/4)*8.4)\nprint((60/9)*8.25)\n\n125.00000000000001\n126.0\n55.0\n\n\nRegarding the number of hours described in the article, this is described as â6 hours per dayâ for the outpatients - which differs to the 8.25 hours to 9 that align with the provided patient numbers and inter-arrival times.\nAssuming this variation is simply related to rounding the IAT - as if we calculate these values based on there being 8.5 hours per day then round the IAT, we get the same resultsâ¦\n\n# IAT 3. Arrivals 170\nprint(60/(170/8.5))\n\n# IAT 4. Arrivals 125-130\nprint(60/(125/8.5))\nprint(60/(130/8.5))\n\n# IAT 9. Arrivals 55-60\nprint(60/(55/8.5))\nprint(60/(60/8.5))\n\n3.0\n4.08\n3.923076923076923\n9.272727272727273\n8.5\n\n\nAs such, the inter-arrival times used were calculated as 3, 6 and 8â¦\n\n# 170, 85 and 65 arrivals\nprint(60/(170/8.5))\nprint(60/(85/8.5))\nprint(60/(65/8.5))\n\n3.0\n6.0\n7.846153846153846"
