This is likely because most healthcare DES studies are undertaken to help analyse and/or solve specific problems associated with a facility, whereas our study aims to contribute towards establishing the computational infrastructure required to analyse the public health system in a region.‚Äù\n‚Äúour research contribution here involves the inclusion of limited inpatient care and childbirth care in our PHC models inaddition to modelling general OPD consultations and emergency cases‚Äù\n‚Äúour literature search did not yield any study that computationally examined: a) PHC operations, and b) how their operational performance would respond to changes in demand and/or capacity. Further, there appears to be very limited healthcare facility simulations in general in the Indian context. Our study aims to address these gaps.‚Äù\n\nModel design:\n\nVisited ‚Äúmultiple PHCs in a semi- urban/rural district in North India and collecting data regarding their operational patterns.‚Äù\nThen designed ‚Äúarchetypal or ‚Äògeneric‚Äô DES model of PHC operations based on the commonalities‚Äù and ‚Äúadapt (reuse with modification) this generic model to represent the different operational configurations encountered in our visits.‚Äù\nAlso compared with ‚Äúbenchmark configuration conforming to government-mandated operational guidelines, with demand estimated from disease burden data and service times closer to international estimates, which are significantly higher than observed service times at the PHCs.‚Äù\n\nFour patient types:\n\nOutpatients\nInpatients and/or emergency (‚Äúrequiring care and observation for brief periods‚Äù e.g.¬†injuries, diarrhoea)\nChildbirth\nAntenatal\n\nResources:\n\nDoctors (1 or 2, depending on configuration)\nNurses: (a) non-communicable disease trained, present during outpatient hours (b) staff nurses, for inpatient/emergency/childbird\nPharmacists (outpatient hours)\nLaboratory technician (outpatient hours)\nInpatient and childbirth beds\n\nFocus:\n\n‚Äúoperational outcomes such as the average waiting time of patients for various resources (e.g., doctors, pharmacy, clinical laboratory), resource utilisation levels across the PHC, and the proportions of childbirth patients who wait longer than a certain time threshold.‚Äù\n‚Äúexperiments to quantify how these PHC configurations respond to changes (increases) in demand, and identify solutions to potentially improve operational efficiency under conditions of high demand.‚Äù"

In arXiv paper, they are presented quite seperately (although they are put together more in the simulation paper).\nFigure 3 - as for figure 2\nFigure 4 - in scope\n\nResults from the abstract or results section that I can‚Äôt currently spot as being covered by the tables and figures:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSections quoted from Shoaib and Ramamohan (2021)\nPrecise result to be reproduced\nThoughts on whether to include in scope\n\n\n\n\n4.3 ‚ÄúWe also note that waiting times for outpatient-related resources (laboratory, OPD consultation, etc. - not depicted in Figures 3a ‚Äì 3d) increase marginally because the associated resources are also required by inpatient/childbirth/ANC cases, which increase in number in the above scenarios‚Äù\nNo - just marginal increase\nNo? Could argue not in scope, as all you‚Äôre aiming for is ‚Äúseeing a marginal increase‚Äù - but likewise, if you saw the opposite of that, you could argue it‚Äôs not being reproduced. However, leaning towards the latter as nothing precise\n\n\n4.3.1 ‚ÄúTo address this, we experimented with letting the staff nurse (whose utilisation is approximately 32%) take over the administrative work. This led to a 12% drop in the utilisation level, which implied that the doctor‚Äôs utilisation still exceeded 100%. Implementing this measure resulted in increasing the staff nurse utilisation to nearly 40%.‚Äù\nStaff nurse does all administrative work (none to doctor). Look at impact on doctor‚Äôs utilisation. When have outpatient load 170 patients per day.\nMaybe? - depends if I have interpreted the described scenario correctly\n\n\n4.3.1 ‚Äúthen considered a situation wherein the staff nurses require minimal intervention in childbirth cases. We assumed that in 50% of childbirth cases, staff nurses require no intervention by the doctor; require only one- third of the typical amount of intervention in 30% of cases, and require full intervention in the remaining 20% of cases. This led to a decrease of the doctor‚Äôs utilisation to 101% (a further decrease of approximately 1%), and an increase in the nurse‚Äôs utilisation to 40%.‚Äù\n50% childbirth have no doctor. 30% have one-third of typical amount of doctor intervention. 20% have full doctor intervention. Look at doctor and nurse utilisation. Normal doctor attendance described in 3.3.3 is that, if doctor is available, patient is attended by both a doctor and a staff nurse - and if not available, then they attend once available, with first-come first-serve alongside inpatient. In Table 4, can see doctor childbirth service time is from uniform distribution with min 30 max 60.\nYes? Think it might be in scope, and has precise results to reproduce\n\n\n4.3.1 ‚Äúinvestigated the effect of stationing an additional doctor in the PHC. This yielded an average utilisation of well below 100% for each doctor.‚Äù\nNo precise result\nNo? Potentially not as doesn‚Äôt have a precise result, just ‚Äúwell below 100%‚Äù\n\n\n4.3.2 ‚ÄúWe also observe that if the number of beds is reduced to four from six, the utilisation level is observed to be approximately thirty-three percent even under higher demand conditions (two inpatient and childbirth cases/day).‚Äù\nApx. 33% inpatient bed utilisation when there are four bed and there are 2 inpatient and childbirth cases per day\nMaybe? Only gives an approximate result which it says holders ‚Äúeven under higher demand‚Äù but is not specific to those conditions, and so could be a few percent different or more, depending on interpretation of ‚Äúapproximate‚Äù. Hence, not sure if precise enough to reproduce.\n\n\n4.3.3 ‚ÄúWhen the administrative work alone is assigned to the staff nurse the average utilisation of the NCD nurse decreases to 100%‚Äù\nOutpatient IAT 3 min and administrative work just performed by staff nurse (and not NCD nurse), NCD nurse utilisation 100%\nMaybe? Might be precise enough?\n\n\n4.3.3 ‚ÄúFurther, in addition to the administrative work when the staff nurse assisted for NCD checks (for 10% cases) the utilisation of NCD nurse dropped to 71%.‚Äù\nIf 10% cases assigned to staff nurse instead of NCD, when outpatient IAT 3 min, NCD utilisation is 71%\nMaybe? Might be precise enough, assuming I‚Äôve interpreted scenario correctly?\n\n\n\nAppendix C - not relevant, focused on validation."

Further, we also find that a significant proportion of childbirth patients (approximately 16- 28% when the number of childbirth cases/day varies from 1-2) wait longer than two hours before receiving admission into the childbirth facility (bed) at a PHC‚Äù"
